    <h2>Application of Machine Learning in the Field of Medical Care</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Disease Diagnosis and Prediction:</b> ML algorithms can analyze vast amounts of patient data, including medical history, symptoms, and test results, to identify patterns and predict the likelihood of certain diseases. This can lead to earlier diagnoses and interventions, potentially improving patient outcomes.</li>
            <li><b>Medical Imaging Analysis:</b> Machine learning can be used to analyze medical images like X-rays, CT scans, and mammograms. ML algorithms can highlight abnormalities and even suggest diagnoses, helping radiologists work more efficiently and effectively.</li>
            <li><b>Administrative Tasks and Efficiency:</b> ML can automate many time-consuming administrative tasks in healthcare, such as scheduling appointments, coding diagnoses, and managing patient records. This frees up doctors and nurses to spend more time with patients.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Automatic Detection of Unexpected Accidents Under CCTV Monitoring</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Object Detection:</b> A deep learning model, like Faster R-CNN, is trained on a massive dataset of video frames containing vehicles and potential accidents. This allows the model to identify and localize objects like cars, trucks, and people in the CCTV footage.</li>
            <li><b>Unusual Object Behavior:</b> Unexpected events like vehicles going the wrong way, stopping abruptly in traffic lanes, or large objects falling on the road can be flagged for further investigation.</li>
        </ul>
